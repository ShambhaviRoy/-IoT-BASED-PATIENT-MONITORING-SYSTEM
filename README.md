# IoT Based Patient Monitoring System
Developed a smart patient monitoring system using Arduino UNO to monitor physiological parameters like heart rate and body temperature of a patient giving email notifications to user in case of abnormal condition.

Hardware Components:

●	Ardino UNO

●	Heartbeat (Pulse) Sensor: It counts the heartbeat for specific interval of time and estimates Beats per Minute

●	Temperature Sensor: It measures the temperature and both the data are sent to the Arduino UNO microcontroller for transmission to receiving end.

●	Buzzer

●	LEDs

●	Resistors

Working:
The sensors are connected to the Arduino UNO microcontroller to track the status which is in turn interfaced to an LCD display as well as Buzzer in order to transmit alerts. The values from the Microcontroller is given the Buzzer. If system detects any abrupt changes in patient heartbeat or body temperature, the system automatically alerts the user about the patient’s status through the buzzer and also shows details of heartbeat and temperature of patient on IDE.

Future Scope:
In the designed system the enhancement would be connecting more sensors to measure various other health parameters and would be beneficial for patient monitoring (especially Old People who need attention 24*7).
